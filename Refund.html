          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            At <strong>Dynamic Media Craft</strong>, we focus on delivering

        <div class="legal-card">
          <h2>2. Project-Based Services</h2>
          <p>
            Once a project has started and resources have been allocated,
            payments made are generally non-refundable. This includes strategy,
            design, development, content, and consulting services.

        <div class="legal-card">
          <h2>3. Cancellation Before Project Start</h2>
          <p>
            If a client cancels the project before any work has begun, a partial
            or full refund may be considered after deducting administrative or
            processing charges.

        <div class="legal-card">
          <h2>4. Milestone-Based Payments</h2>
          <p>
            For milestone-based projects, payments made for completed milestones
            are non-refundable. Any upcoming milestones not yet started may be
            canceled without additional charges.
